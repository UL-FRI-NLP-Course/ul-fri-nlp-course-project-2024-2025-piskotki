## About
This is <b>Project 1</b> which is part of the Natural Language Processing course for the academic year 2024/2025, where we aim to explore advanced techniques in conversational AI. Specifically, we will focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to develop a chatbot capable of retrieving and integrating external information in real-time.

## Team: Piškotki
- Ana Poklukar
- Kristjan Sever
- Blaž Grilj

## Repository Structure  
- **`data/`**: Datasets for training and evaluation, including external documents.  
- **`report/`**: Contains all report documents, both source files and PDFs.
- **`src/`**: Contains the source code needed for the project.

## Building Report
Must have installed docker.

Run `./compile.sh` in the `./report` directory. The script will generate a couple of intermediate files, which can be ignored. Final PDF is saved as `report.pdf`
